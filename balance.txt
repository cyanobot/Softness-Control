vanilla beds rest effectiveness: 
sleeping spot 80%
bedroll (any) 95%
bed 100%
hospital bed 100%
royal bed 105%


soft warm beds
sleeping spot 30%
hammock (cloth=62%) 109%
hammock (plainleather=32%) 79%
bedroll (cloth=62%) 107%
bedroll (plainleather=32%) 77%
bed (unmade) 50%
bed (cloth=62%) 112%
bed (plainleather=32%) 82%

as good as a vanilla bed = 50%
cloth is an extra expense over vanilla so being a little better doesn't seem unfair
even moderately bad bedding should be at least 30%
